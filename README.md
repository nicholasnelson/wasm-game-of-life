## About

This originally started with the excellent [Conway's Game of Life in Rust and WebAssembly](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/game-of-life/introduction.html) tutorial. It's spawned an unhealthy level of interest in Conway's Game of Life, and I'm working to build this up to a platform from which to launch further experiments.
